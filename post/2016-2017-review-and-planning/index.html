<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>

<p>2016 was a great year for me - a little bit chaotic too. (If you didn&rsquo;t know - I love chaos). Especially the first half. The important thing - learned a ton and enjoyed the year to the fullest.</p>

<h4 id="review-of-2016">Review of 2016</h4>

<h5 id="first-half">First half</h5>

<p>First half of year I spent with the ESN (organisation I still volunteer in). Kinda miss the experience, but you know what they say - I am happy it happened. I like to remember every single person I got to meet during that time. <em>Feeling grateful to every single one of them for the experience</em>. During that time I got to continue to level up leadership, communication skills. Thanks Viktorija and Ieva L. for opportunity. Special thanks goes to my mentor <em>Mindaugas V.</em> for teaching on how to reflect and lead.</p>

<h5 id="second-half">Second half</h5>

<p>The other half of the year. Oh yes - that is when software engineering part happened. After a good pause of &ldquo;real&rdquo; engineering I though it was going to be harder to catch up. Turned out, few weeks and I was back at the game. After half a year of &ldquo;pure&rdquo; engineering I can say I am currently at best shape I ever was. Could have done more, but at the same time I can also say I was pretty lucky at meeting the right people. Analytical, estimations skills were completely missing from my vocabulary. Thanks to my team at work - now I know that I know nothing about them. Will need to learn more about them.</p>

<p>Other achievements - I will say that starting a blog was quite a big one for me.
&gt; I just need to learn to write</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what pushed me. And still keeping at it! As a side bonus - learning about keeping web in &ldquo;production&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Starting work on side-project. A little to no progress - but I did start. Will write about it more in the future. From my point of view - also a step in right direction.</p>

<p>Volunteering took quite a part too. Just this time instead of working as a president I was more like team lead. In other words - chairing IT committee for ESN Lithuania. Aside from other committee activities I focused on development and design of internal HR system. Could have done more in this area - but I&rsquo;ll stick around and try to finish what I started.</p>

<p>Real grateful for - my SO, Donata. Who supports me in everything I do. That is my secret for doing things instead of being lazy.</p>

<h5 id="regressions">Regressions</h5>

<p>Focusing so much on engineering, communication, leadership and other skills came with a cost. Health and fitness + learning new things about self-development. Health and fitness levels did go down the most. This is the biggest regression. As for self-dev - while I did keep reflecting on myself - I stopped learning new things.</p>

<h4 id="2017-master-plan">2017 - Master plan</h4>

<p><em>Focus on health and fitness</em>. Priority goal! Hope to achieve even better results than I achieved in 2014 Half 2 / 2015 Half 1. Vessel for brain is important - take care of it!</p>

<p>Other goals?</p>

<p>Instead of exploring new things I am planning to stick to things I started this year. I think I did enough &ldquo;random&rdquo; exploring past 7 years. All this exploring will have a clearer goal - become a better frontend engineer. From low level knowledge such as language constructs to high level analysis, communication. I actually expect this point of view have a positive impact on me. Due to prioritising on what is important today and what will be valuable in 10 years.</p>

<p>Side project development - need expertise on how to take pet project to real world.</p>

<p>Keeping up with blog. I think knowing how to write is important - that is my way of learning that.</p>

<p>Catch up with learning about self development. Plan is to make a habit - already failed twice. This time I will I&rsquo;ll start with checking why I need this - make clearer goal.</p>

<p>Backups, security - at some point I want to do a checkup on my infrastructure for backing up and security.</p>

<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>

<p>Reflections are in place, a &ldquo;guide&rdquo; plan is ready - planning to enjoy every minute of 2017.</p>
